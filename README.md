# Simple Game
This is a work in progress and will receive updates.

## Introduction

This is a simple scrolling game created using Pygame. The player controls a character that can move horizontally and jump to avoid obstacles. The goal is to survive as long as possible while collecting points.

## Features

- **Player Controls:** Use the A and D keys to move the player left and right. Press the SPACE key to make the player jump.

- **Obstacles:** Randomly generated obstacles move from right to left. Avoid collisions with the obstacles to maintain lives.

- **Lives:** The player starts with three lives. Colliding with obstacles decreases the number of lives. The game ends when all lives are lost.

- **Pause Menu:** Press the ESC key during the game to access the pause menu. Navigate through the options to resume the game, adjust the volume, or quit the game.
